# Isolation-forest

This repository project is an implementation of the anomaly detection algorithm Isolation Forest, which can be found in a paper published by Fei Tony Liu, Kai Ming Ting, and Zhi-Hua Zhou. You can read the paper here [Isolation Forest](https://github.com/ReaganHuang/Isolation-forest/blob/master/IsolationForestPaper.pdf). 

Here, I applied Isolation Forest on a credit card dataset to look for fraud. The dataset can be found here [credit card dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
